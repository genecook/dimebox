dimebox tasks (in no particular order)
----------------------------------------
 * libelf - implement script to download/build (elftoolchain) libelf. - DONE

 * boost - implement script to download/build boost cmdline args lib. - DONE

 * main.C - clone windvane main, breakout cmdline args as separate code
    define config file format + code to parse. define config struct. - DONE

 * Integrate in (windvane) physical/logical memory. - DONE

 * system timer? (from windvane)

 * Integrate uart (use existing PLA011 for now; morph windvane pla uart into ns later). - DONE.

 * Archive on github. - DONE.

 * Implement app registers, PC, SP. - DONE

 * Implement 'top level' simulator class, simulation loop. - DONE.

 * Implement cmake file (CMakeLists.txt) - DONE.

 * Download/install risc-v tool chain. - DONE.
 
 * Implement rv32i instructions. - DONE. 

 * Integrate in gdb 'server' code. (windvane) - DONE.

 * Implement rv32i control & status instructions. - DONE.

 * Debug simulator. - runs, loads elf file, simulates a few instructions. - DONE.

 * Debug uart accesses. - DONE.
 
 * Exercize gdb, debug simulator.
 
 * Download/build riscv isa acceptance tests - tests built okay. benchmark test build fails due to
   building risc-v tool chain for rv32 (benchmark build expects rv64?)
   
 * Integer instructions - debug using riscv isa tests
   --debugged single test rv32ui-p-addi (built using default target)
   --need to analyze/add in ecall pass/fail logic at simulator exit
   --debug a few more rv32ui-p tests, then automate testing for the lot.

 * Implement pseudo real-time clock
   ( use wall clock + core clock to derive real-time clock 'tics'
   only when real-time clock is accessed?)

 * README.md - ONGOING.
